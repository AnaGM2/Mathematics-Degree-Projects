# Linear Programming

This folder contains the practical implementation of optimization models using **Octave** and **GeoGebra**. The course focused on modeling real-world problems as linear programs and solving them through various algorithmic approaches.

## Course Practices

### 1. Graphical & Basic Methods
* Resolution of 2D linear programs using **GeoGebra** for feasible region visualization.
* Implementation of the **Simplex Method** foundations in Octave.

### 2. Integer & Binary Programming
* Modeling complex logical conditions using binary variables ($0-1$).
* Solvin decision-making models.

### 3. Network Optimization
* Optimization of flows and paths over networks.
* Applications in logistics, transport, and resource distribution.

### 4. Advanced Linear Modeling
* **L1-Norm Linear Regression:** Minimizing the sum of absolute residuals for a given point cloud, formulated as a Linear Programming problem.
* **Min-Max Optimization:** Reformulating non-linear objective functions (like absolute values and maximums) into equivalent linear forms.

## Tech Stack
* **Octave:** For matrix-based optimization and algorithm execution.
* **GeoGebra:** For geometric interpretation of constraints and objective functions.
