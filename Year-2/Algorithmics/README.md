# Algorithmics

This repository contains the core algorithmic foundations developed during my second year of the Mathematics degree. It covers everything from basic syntax to complex programming paradigms and object-oriented logic.

## Repository Structure
The content is organized by topic, each containing:
* `Theory-Programs/`: Scripts from theoretical lectures.
* `Practice-Exercises/`: Solutions to algorithmic challenges and practical applications.

Additionally, a final project is included, featuring a technical report that explains the utility of each implemented function. This project consists of the development of an application that allows searching across multiple databases containing movies and series available on video-on-demand platforms.
