# Linear Geometry: Conics and Quadrics Visualizations

This project showcases interactive geometric constructions created with **GeoGebra**. It focuses on the visualization of second-order curves (conics) and surfaces (quadrics), emphasizing their analytical properties and canonical forms.

## Practice I: Conic Sections & Optics
A study of locus-based constructions and the reflective properties (rays) of conics.

* **Core Curves:** Ellipse, Hyperbola, and Parabola.
* **Optical Properties:** Implementation of reflection principles.
* **Analytical Geometry:** Reduction to the canonical form of a conic.

## Practice II: Quadric Surfaces
3D modeling of complex surfaces and their traces on coordinate planes.

* **Ruled Surfaces:** Hyperbolic paraboloid and one-sheet hyperboloid.
* **Classic Quadrics:** Cones, cylinders, and two-sheet hyperboloids.
* **Structural Analysis:** Traces and intersection planes.
