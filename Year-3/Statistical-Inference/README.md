## Project: Culture & Travel Habits

This project explores the relationship between general cultural knowledge and travel preferences through a real-world data collection and statistical validation process. The study aims to determine if an individual's cultural level (measured via a standardized test) influences their travel frequency, destination choices, and travel style.

### Key Research Questions:
* **Cultural Level vs. Education:** Is the test score lower than expected based on formal education levels?
* **Travel Frequency:** Is there a significant correlation between culture and how often people travel?
* **Preferences:** Domestic vs. International travel choices based on cultural background.
* **Demographics:** Analysis of age and travel companionship (e.g., traveling as a couple).
* **Activity Engagement:** Participation in cultural events among high-scoring individuals.

### Methodology & Statistical Tools
  Even though the data was analyzed in R, the core of the project relies on **Inferential Statistics**:
* **Hypothesis Testing:** To validate assumptions about population means and proportions.
* **Correlation Analysis:** To identify relationships between cultural scores and travel habits.
* **Data Collection:** Design and distribution of a custom survey to a random population sample.

## Repository Structure
* `raw_data.xlsx`: Raw data collected from participants.
* `clean_data.xlsx`: Data collected from participants after being processed.
* `Trabajo_Inferencia.pdf`: Document containing the methodology, statistical tests performed, p-values, and final conclusions.

## AI Relevance
* **Data Literacy:** This project demonstrates the ability to handle raw survey data, a crucial step in any Data Science pipeline.
* **Hypothesis Validation:** In AI, understanding if a result is statistically significant is key to model evaluation.
