# Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics

This repository serves as an archive of the laboratory work and computational projects completed during my Bachelor’s Degree in Mathematics. It documents my transition from theoretical foundations to applied numerical analysis and data modeling.

## Overview

The repository is organized chronologically by academic year. Each course folder contains specific subjects where I applied mathematical theory using various programming languages and software.

## Tech Stack

Throughout the degree, I utilized a diverse set of tools to bridge the gap between abstract theorems and executable code and computational applications:

* **Programming & Scripting:** Python, R, Octave, SQL, HTML

* **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Excel, Power BI, GeoGebra

* **Specialized Mathematical Software:** GAP (Groups, Algorithms, Programming)

* **Documentation & Reproducible Research:** LaTeX, Markdown, R Markdown, Jupyter Notebooks

## How to Navigate

  1. Select a Year Folder (e.g., `Year-1/`).
  2. Select a Subject Folder (e.g., `Statistics/`).
  3. Read the local `README.md` within that folder for specific instructions on how to run the code and the mathematical context of the projects.
