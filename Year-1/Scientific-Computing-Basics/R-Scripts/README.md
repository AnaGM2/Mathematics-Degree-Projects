# Scientific Computing & Data Analysis with R

This repository contains the set of works, labs, and projects developed during the **"Scientific Computing and Text Processing"** course, tracking my progress from basic R syntax to advanced functional programming and geological data analysis.

## Key Skills
* **Programming:** Custom functions, nested loops (`for`, `while`), and recursive logic.
* **Data Science:** Handling built-in datasets (`iris`, `rock`, `quakes`, `cars`), data cleaning, and statistical summaries.
* **Mathematics:** Linear algebra, trigonometry (Law of Cosines), and number theory (Primes, Amicable numbers).
* **Visualization:** Multi-paneled plots, mathematical function rendering, and professional formatting in Base R.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Course Foundations (`Class-Notes/`)
* **`Script-1.R`**: Intro to R environments, vectors, matrices, and DataFrames.
* **`Script-2.R`**: Visualization basics and graphics device management (`par`, `png`).
* **`Script-3.R`**: Functional programming and logical branching.
* **`Resumen.R`**: A comprehensive Cheat Sheet for quick syntax reference.

### 2. Applied Practices (`Practices/`)
* **`Practica-1`**: Mastering R's Recycling Rule and matrix algebra.
* **`Practica-2`**: Advanced plotting (line types, colors, and overlays with `par(new=TRUE)`).
* **`Practica-3`**: Efficiency analysis, comparing Vectorization vs. Loops.
* **`Practica-Adicional`**: Algorithmic challenges including the Fibonacci Sequence and prime number exploration.

### 3. Deliverables & Exam (`Projects/`)
* **`Entregable.R` (Final Project)**: 
    * **Amicable & Perfect Numbers**: A mathematical engine to find number relationships.
    * **Geological Analysis**: A 4-panel dashboard analyzing the `rock` dataset.
    * **Triangle Solver**: A geometric tool using the Law of Cosines.
* **`Examen.R` (Final Exam)**: 
    * Real-world data filtering using the `quakes` dataset.
    * Nested loop implementation for vector cross-products.
