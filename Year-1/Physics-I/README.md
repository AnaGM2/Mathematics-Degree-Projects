# **Physics I: Numerical Simulations**

This module covers the numerical resolution of complex physical problems using Octave.

* Applied Concepts: Analysis of dynamical systems and visualization of 2D and 3D trajectories.

* Key Problems: Simulation of magnetic fields and damped oscillators.

It consists of the following content:

* `Scripts/`: A folder containing the scripts with the examples covered in class.

* `Exercises/`: A folder containing the exercises solved during the practical sessions.

* `Informe Fisica I.pdf`: The final report featuring the obtained results.
