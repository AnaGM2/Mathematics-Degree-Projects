# **Physics I: Numerical Simulations**

This module covers the numerical resolution of complex physical problems using Octave.

* Applied Concepts: Numerical integration of differential equations of motion, analysis of dynamical systems, and visualization of 2D and 3D trajectories.

* Key Problems: Simulation of magnetic fields and damped oscillators.
