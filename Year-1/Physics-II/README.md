# Physics II: Electromagnetic Fields & Wave Optics

This module contains computational simulations developed in **Python (Jupyter Notebooks)** for the study of electromagnetic and wave phenomena.

## Lab Content

### 1. Motion of Charges in Electromagnetic Fields
Simulation and analysis of charged particle behavior under different field configurations:
* **Mass Spectrometer**
* **Velocity Selector**
* **Cyclotron**
* **Relativistic Effects**

### 2. Wave Interference and Diffraction
Numerical study of wave superposition and diffraction patterns.

## Results
Each lab includes a **detailed report (PDF)** featuring:
1. Theoretical foundations and applied differential equations.
2. Plots generated by the code.
3. Conclusions and validation of the physical models.
