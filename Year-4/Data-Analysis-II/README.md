# Data Analysis II

This repository covers advanced multivariate statistics, generalized linear models, and their application to real-world business intelligence. It culminates in a comprehensive final project integrating a full data science stack (**SQL, Python, R, and Power BI**).

## Final Project: Business Simulation
* **Goal:** Applied theoretical concepts to a real company dataset to solve a business problem, acting as a Data Scientist within a simulated corporate environment
* **Pipeline:** * **SQL:** Data extraction and manipulation.
    * **R & Python:** Advanced statistical modeling (GLM, Logistic Regression) and predictive analytics.
    * **Power BI:** Developed interactive dashboards to communicate results to non-technical stakeholders.
* **Outcome:** Final presentation of insights and model performance metrics.

* **Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis & Stakeholder Engagement**
  * **Business Context:** We conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis on a large banking dataset (approximately 45,000 instances), related to marketing campaigns offering customers a long-term deposit.
  * **Business Intelligence:** We developed a Power BI dashboard to visualize demographic trends, financial indicators, and campaign effectiveness, enabling data-driven decision-making.
* **Part 2: Predictive Modeling & Advanced Analytics with R**
  * **Model Development:** We built and fine-tuned statistical classification models in R to predict the likelihood of customers subscribing to long-term deposits.
  * **Technique Comparison:** We evaluated different approaches, including Logistic Regression and Decision Trees, selecting the most robust model for the specific banking context.
  * **Performance Metrics:** For each model, we used performance indicators such as Accuracy, Recall, and Specificity, providing a quantitative justification for the chosen solution.
  * **Technical Reporting:** We synthesized the technical results into a presentation, defending the methodology and business value in a simulated corporate setting.
* **Part 3: Machine Learning with Python & Data Extraction with SQL**
  * **Database Querying:** We used SQL to perform complex data extraction and exploratory descriptive summaries, ensuring data integrity.
  * **Machine Learning Integration:** We implemented advanced predictive models in Python using libraries such as Scikit-learn, transitioning from statistical modeling to robust machine learning workflows.
  * **Advanced Model Evaluation:** We compared and cross-validated multiple algorithms, focusing on metrics such as ROC curves and F1-score, to maximize the economic efficiency of the marketing campaign.
  * **Final Corporate Defense:** We acted as a Senior Data Scientist in a final "business review" session, defending the technical infrastructure and results, and the transition from R to Python to meet corporate scalability requirements.
