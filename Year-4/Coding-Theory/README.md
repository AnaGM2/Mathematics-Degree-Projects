# Coding Theory

This folder contains the resolution of advanced problems in **Coding Theory** using **GAP** (Groups, Algorithms, and Programming). The focus was on the construction, analysis, and decoding of codes.

## Topics Covered
* **Linear Codes:** Construction and analysis of generator and parity-check matrices.
* **Systematic Codes:** Conversion of codes to systematic form through Gaussian elimination and column independence analysis.
* **Dual Codes:** Computation of dual codes and the dual-of-dual property to retrieve original code structures.
* **Metric Properties:** Calculation of Hamming weights, minimum distance ($d$), and the weight distribution of codewords.
* **Decoding Techniques:** Implementation of Syndrome decoding, Slepian tables, and coset leader identification.
* **Error Correction Capability:** Determination of the packing radius and reliability of decoding systems (complete vs. incomplete decoding).
* **Algebraic Verification:** Membership testing of vectors within a code.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** GAP (Groups, Algorithms, and Programming).

## Relevance
* Coding theory is one of the pillars of cryptography.
* Demonstrates the ability to master specialized mathematical software beyond general-purpose languages.
