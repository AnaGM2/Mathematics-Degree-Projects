## Network Theory: Fundamentals and Applications in Climate Science

This final project focuses on exploring the mathematical foundations of Network Theory and its application in climate science. Given that climate is a complex system with multiple interrelated variables, Network Theory represents a powerful tool to understand its structure and dynamics.

It begins with an introduction that briefly addresses the history of Network Theory, the definition of a network, and the objectives of the project. Following that, it delves into the general concepts of Graph Theory, including definitions, graph examples, and the fundamental metrics for characterizing network structures.

Subsequently, random networks are examined, studying different models such as Erdös-Rényi, Barabási-Albert, or Watts-Strogatz, as well as their implementation in Python. Small-world phenomenon and network clustering coefficients are also introduced.

Finally, the study of global air temperature using Network Theory is addressed. This final chapter is dedicated to applying the acquired knowledge in Network Theory to analyze realistic climate data from a numerical model. This approach aims not only to provide a better understanding of Network Theory, but also to apply this knowledge in a practical context and demonstrate its potential usefulness in addressing current climate challenges, such as the identification of climate patterns and their teleconnections.
